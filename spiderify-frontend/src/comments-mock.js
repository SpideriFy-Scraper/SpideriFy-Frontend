Came with backpack and mouse pad as described. Initial start up was slow, but moving fast now that it’s set up. Only gave 3 stars because the RAM is a significant part in purchasing the right laptop!",

I am so amazed by the backpack & mouse pad quality, and I don’t mind the little legendary logo both accessories. I had HP laptops previously and had been pleased with their performance. This one is exceptional for someone who isn't into a lot of gaming and such. I am self employed and I bought this laptop for my work, I only need basic internet browsing and need to do some basic excel reporting, so this computer is perfect for me and at an amazing price, especially it came with bonus accessories.",

I will keep the power cable near by.  if you are using less, you might make a full day on a charge.",
